Automated discounts are a game-changer for Shopify merchants. Instead of manually creating discount codes or running complex scripts, you can set up rules that apply discounts automatically at checkout based on various conditions.

## Why Automated Discounts?

Traditional discount codes have several limitations:

- Customers need to remember and enter codes
- Codes can be shared publicly, reducing control
- Manual management becomes tedious with multiple campaigns
- Limited flexibility in targeting specific conditions

With automated discounts, you can create sophisticated campaigns that apply seamlessly at checkout.

## Your First Campaign

Here's how to create your first automated discount campaign:

### 1. Define Your Goal

Start by identifying what you want to achieve:

- Clear excess inventory?
- Reward loyal customers?
- Promote specific product categories?
- Drive sales during slow periods?
### 2. Set Your Conditions

MyCampaigner allows you to target discounts based on:

- Product tags and collections
- Inventory levels
- Customer tags and segments
- Purchase history
- Cart value
- Time and date ranges
- Time and date ranges

### 3. Configure Your Discount

Choose your discount type:

- **Percentage off:** Great for promotions (e.g., 20% off)
- **Fixed amount:** Good for specific price points
- **Buy X Get Y:** Perfect for bundles

## Best Practices

### Start Small
Begin with a simple campaign targeting one product category or customer segment. Monitor results before expanding.

### Test Your Rules
Always test campaigns in preview mode before activating them to ensure they work as expected.

### Monitor Performance

Track key metrics:

- Conversion rate
- Average order value
- Discount usage
- Revenue impact

### Iterate and Optimize
Use analytics to refine your campaigns. What works for one audience might not work for another.

### Inventory Clearance

Automatically increase discounts on products with high inventory levels:

```
IF inventory > 100 THEN 20% off
IF inventory > 200 THEN 30% off
```inventory > 100 THEN 20% off
IF inventory > 200 THEN 30% off
### VIP Customer Rewards

Give your best customers special treatment:

```
IF customer tag = "VIP" THEN 15% off all orders
```
IF customer tag = "VIP" THEN 15% off all orders
### Seasonal Promotions

Schedule campaigns for specific dates:

```
Holiday Sale: 25% off Dec 1-25
Back to School: 20% off Aug 15-Sep 15
```iday Sale: 25% off Dec 1-25
Back to School: 20% off Aug 15-Sep 15
```

## Conclusion

Automated discounts save time, increase conversions, and give you precise control over your pricing strategy. Start with simple rules and gradually build more sophisticated campaigns as you learn what works best for your store.
